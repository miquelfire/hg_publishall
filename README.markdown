Hg-publishall
=============

Hg-publishall is a [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) extension which
allows you to push simultaneously to multiple repositories, in a single
command.

Installation
------------

First, clone the repository, let's say in your home directory:

    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Kizlum/hg-publishall ~/hg-publishall

Then add the following to your .hgrc file in order to activate the extension:

    [extensions]
    publishall = /Users/thomas/code/hg-publishall/hg-publishall/publishall.py

And voil√†!

Usage
-----

Add as many paths as you want to your repository/.hg/hgrc file, and when you
want to push, use one of the following:

    hg pushall
    hg pusha
